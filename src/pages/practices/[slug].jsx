const PRACTICE_DETAILS = {
  'crop-rotation': {
    what: 'Crop rotation is the practice of growing different types of crops in the same area across different growing seasons. This ancient technique breaks pest and disease cycles, replenishes soil nutrients, and reduces the need for synthetic fertilizers. Each crop family uses and adds different nutrients, so alternating them keeps the soil in balance naturally. A well-planned rotation can reduce fertilizer costs by 20-30% and increase yields by 10-15% over 3-5 years.',
    why: ['Breaks the life cycle of soil-borne pests and diseases that target specific crops', 'Legumes fix atmospheric nitrogen, reducing fertilizer cost for the next crop', 'Prevents soil erosion and compaction by varying root structures each season', 'Improves long-term soil health, leading to higher yields over multiple years', 'Reduces weed pressure as different crops compete differently with weeds'],
    steps: ['Divide your farm into at least 2-3 sections', 'Plan the rotation sequence: e.g., Rice then Groundnut then Wheat then Fallow', 'After harvest, leave crop residue in the field to decompose before the next planting', 'Introduce a legume (groundnut, cowpea, green gram) at least once in the 3-year cycle', 'Do not plant the same crop family in the same plot two seasons in a row', 'Keep a written record of each plot crop history for at least 3 years'],

    related: ['Mulching', 'Composting', 'Intercropping'],
  },
  'mulching': {
    what: 'Mulching involves covering the soil surface around plants with organic or inorganic material. Organic mulches include straw, dried leaves, sugarcane bagasse, and paddy husk. Inorganic mulches include black plastic film. Mulching conserves soil moisture by reducing evaporation by up to 50%, suppresses weed growth, moderates soil temperature, and as organic mulches decompose, they add nutrients and improve soil structure.',
    why: ['Reduces irrigation frequency by 30-50% by conserving soil moisture', 'Suppresses weed growth, reducing weeding labour costs significantly', 'Moderates soil temperature, protecting roots from extreme heat and cold', 'Organic mulches decompose and improve soil organic matter over time', 'Prevents soil splash and erosion during heavy rainfall'],

  },
  'intercropping': {
    what: 'Intercropping is the practice of growing two or more crops simultaneously in the same field. The crops are chosen so that they complement each other - one may fix nitrogen while the other uses it, or one may have a deep root system while the other is shallow. Common Indian intercropping systems include groundnut with castor, cotton with cowpea, and maize with beans. This practice maximises land use efficiency and provides income security if one crop fails.',

  },
  'raised-bed-farming': {
    what: 'Raised bed farming involves creating elevated planting areas (15-30 cm high) separated by furrows or pathways. The beds are typically 90-120 cm wide so farmers can reach the center without stepping on the bed. This system improves drainage, prevents waterlogging, allows better root aeration, and makes irrigation and fertilizer application more efficient. It is particularly effective for vegetables, onions, garlic, and root crops.',
    why: ['Prevents waterlogging and improves drainage in heavy soils', 'Soil warms up faster in raised beds, enabling earlier planting', 'Better root aeration leads to healthier plants and higher yields', 'Concentrated fertilizer application reduces input waste', 'Easier weed management as pathways are clearly defined'],

  },
  'flood-irrigation': {
    what: 'Flood irrigation (also called surface irrigation) involves releasing water at the top of a field and allowing it to flow by gravity across the field surface. It is the oldest and most widely used irrigation method in India, particularly for rice and sugarcane. While it requires minimal infrastructure, it is water-inefficient (only 40-50% of water reaches plant roots) and can cause waterlogging and soil erosion if not managed properly.',
    why: ['Lowest infrastructure cost of all irrigation methods', 'Suitable for flat fields with impermeable soils like clay', 'Effective for crops that require standing water like paddy rice', 'No energy cost if water source is at higher elevation', 'Familiar to most farmers with minimal training required'],
    steps: ['Level the field carefully - maximum slope of 0.2% for efficient water distribution', 'Construct field channels (bunds) to direct water flow', 'Open the water inlet and allow water to spread across the field', 'Monitor water depth - rice requires 5-10 cm standing water', 'Close inlet when water reaches the far end of the field', 'Allow field to dry between irrigations to prevent waterlogging'],

    why: ['No chemical residues on produce or in soil', 'Effective monitoring tool to detect pest presence before damage occurs', 'Pheromone traps are highly specific - only target the pest species', 'Reduces pesticide use by 30-50% when used as part of IPM', 'Safe for beneficial insects, farmers, and consumers'],
    steps: ['Install yellow sticky traps at crop canopy height, 1 trap per 250 sq metres', 'Place pheromone traps at 15-20 per acre for bollworm and fruit borer monitoring', 'Check traps every 3-5 days and record pest counts', 'Replace sticky traps when they are full (typically every 2-4 weeks)', 'Replace pheromone lures every 4-6 weeks as per manufacturer instructions', 'Use trap counts to decide when chemical intervention is necessary (economic threshold)'],
    costs: [{ item: 'Yellow sticky traps (pack of 25)', amount: 'Rs 150 - Rs 300' }, { item: 'Pheromone trap with lure', amount: 'Rs 80 - Rs 150 per trap' }, { item: 'Light trap (solar)', amount: 'Rs 2,000 - Rs 5,000' }],
